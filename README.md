# Logistic Regression
This notebook is a capstone project from the Udemy course, Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp.

In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
